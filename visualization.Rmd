  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))
```

In this section, we'll explore visualization methods in R. Visualization has been a key element of R since its inception, since visualization is central to the exploratory philosophy of the language. See https://bookdown.org/igisc/EnvDataSci/ for some examples and setting parameters in base R, but we'll focus on ggplot2.

## ggplot2

\index{ggplot2}The `gpplot2` package, part of the tidyverse (and installed and loaded with `tidyverse`)is based on the *Grammar of Graphics* because it provides considerable control over your graphics while remaining fairly easily readable, as long as you buy into its grammar.

The `ggplot2` app (and its primary function `ggplot`) looks at three aspects of a graph:

-   data : where are the data coming from?
-   geometry : what type of graph are we creating?
-   \index{aesthetics}aesthetics : what choices can we make about symbology and how do we connect symbology to data?

As with other tidyverse and RStudio packages, find the ggplot2 cheat sheet at <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

## Summary statistical graphics

Being a language that strongly supports statistical analysis, R provides quite an array of ways of exploring and analyzing data, and graphics are an important part of that. The visualization chapter of  https://bookdown.org/igisc/EnvDataSci/ includes much more on these methods, and many of these set up the statistical modeling parts of that book. Looking at summary statistics and creating graphs of our data variables will also be important for mapping and other GISc methods, so we'll look at a few examples, but you can explore further  in the larger book.

### Plotting one variable
The `ggplot` function provides plots of single and multiple variables, using various coordinate systems (including geographic). We'll start with just plotting one variable, which might be *continuous* -- where we might want to see a histogram, density plot, or dot plot -- or *discrete* -- where we might want to see something like a a bar graph, like the first example below (Figure \@ref(fig:visSimpleBarGraph)).

We'll look at a study of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from a transect across a montane meadow in the northern Sierra Nevada, derived from multispectral drone imagery [@NDVI].

```{r vis.ggplot.geom_bar, message=F}
library(igisci)
library(tidyverse)
summary(XSptsNDVI)
```

```{r visSimpleBarGraph,  fig.cap="Simple bar graph of meadow vegetation samples"}
ggplot(XSptsNDVI, aes(vegetation)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

### Histogram {#histogram}

\index{histogram}Histograms are very useful for looking at the distribution of continuous variables (Figure \@ref(fig:visNDVIknuthson)). We'll start by using a pivot table (these will be discussed in the next chapter, on data transformation.)  

```{r vis.pivot4plot, message=F}
XSptsPheno <- XSptsNDVI %>%
  filter(vegetation != "pine") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("NDVI"), 
               names_to = "phenology", 
               values_to = "NDVI") %>%
  mutate(phenology = str_sub(phenology, 5, str_length(phenology)))
```

```{r visNDVIknuthson, fig.cap="Distribution of NDVI, Knuthson Meadow"}
XSptsPheno %>%
  ggplot(aes(NDVI)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.05)
```

Histograms can be created in a couple of ways, one the conventional histogram that provides the most familiar view, for instance of the "bell curve" of a normal distribution (Figure \@ref(fig:visTemperaturesHisto)).

```{r visTemperaturesHisto, fig.cap="Distribution of Average Monthly Temperatures, Sierra Nevada"}
sierraData %>%
    ggplot(aes(TEMPERATURE)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="dark green")
```

> Another way is a cumulative histogram, described in https://bookdown.org/igisc/EnvDataSci/ . Another approach is a density plot, which is more of a *continuous* type of histogram, like the following example which also applies an alpha setting to compare two distributions:

```{r visDensityAlpha, fig.cap="Comparative density plot using alpha setting"}
XSptsPheno %>%
  ggplot(aes(NDVI, fill=phenology)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2)
```
### Other statistical graphics

Some other statistical graphics that are useful are boxplots, scatter plots, trend lines, and pairs plots. 

Tukey \index{boxplot}boxplots provide another way of looking at the distributions of continuous variables. Typically these are stratified by a factor, such as `site` in the euc/oak study (Figure \@ref(fig:visBoxplotByRunoff)): 
```{r visBoxplotByRunoff, fig.cap="Boxplot of runoff by site"}
ggplot(data = tidy_eucoak) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = site, y = runoff_L))
```

And then as we did above, we can communicate more by coloring by tree type. Note that this is called *within* the \index{aes}`aes()` function (Figure \@ref(fig:visEucOakRunoffColored)).

```{r visEucOakRunoffColored, fig.cap="Runoff at Bay Area Sites, colored as eucalyptus and oak"}
ggplot(data = tidy_eucoak) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=site, y=runoff_L, color=tree))

```
\index{trend line}When we get to statistical models, the first one we'll look at is a simple linear model. It's often useful to display this as a *trend line*, and this can be done with ggplot2's `geom_smooth()` function, specifying the linear model "lm" method. By default, the graph displays the standard error as a gray pattern (Figure \@ref(fig:visTrendLine)).

```{r visTrendLine, fig.cap="Trend line with a linear model"}
sierraFeb %>%
  ggplot(aes(TEMPERATURE,ELEVATION)) +
  geom_point(color="blue") +
  geom_smooth(color="red", method="lm")
```

```{r visPairsPlot, fig.cap="Pairs plot for Sierra Nevada stations variables"}
sierraFeb %>%
     dplyr::select(ELEVATION:TEMPERATURE) %>%
     pairs()
```



**Visualizing soil CO~2~ data with a box plot**

In a study of soil CO~2~ in the \index{Marble Mountains}Marble Mountains of California [@marblesCO2], we sampled extracted soil air (Figure \@ref(fig:visSoilGasSampling)) in a 11-point transect across Marble Valley in 1997 (Figure \@ref(fig:visMarblesSitesTopo)). Again, a Tukey boxplot is useful for visualization (Figure \@ref(fig:visSoilTukey)).

>Note that in this book you'll often see CO~2~ written as CO2. These are both meant to refer to carbon dioxide, but I've learned that subscripts in figure headings don't always get passed through to the LaTeX compiler for the pdf/printed version, so I'm forced to write it without the subscript. Similarly CH~4~ might be written as CH4, etc. The same applies often to variable names and axis labels in graphs, though there are some workarounds.

```{r visSoilGasSampling, fig.cap = "Marble Valley, Marble Mountains Wilderness, California", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "marbleGap.png"))
```

```{r visMarblesSitesTopo, out.width="50%", fig.cap = "Marble Mountains soil gas sampling sites, with surface topographic features and cave passages", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "marblesCO2map.png"))
```

```{r visSoilTukey, fig.cap = "Visualizing soil CO2 data with a Tukey box plot"}
soilCO2 <- soilCO2_97
soilCO2$SITE <- factor(soilCO2$SITE)  # in order to make the numeric field a factor
ggplot(data = soilCO2, mapping = aes(x = SITE, y = CO2pct)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

## Plotting Two Variables

> See https://bookdown.org/igisc/EnvDataSci/ for methods of graphing two variables, either both continuous or with one discrete.

### Color systems

\index{color systems}There's a lot to working with color, with different color schemes needed for continuous data vs discrete values, and situations like bidirectional data. We'll look into some basics, but the reader is recommended to learn more at sources like <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html> or <https://colorbrewer2.org/> or just Googling "rcolorbrewer" or "colorbrewer" or even "R colors".


#### Specifying colors to use for a graphical element

When a color is requested for an entire graphical element, like geom_point or geom_line, and *not* in the aesthetics, all feature get that color. In the following graph the same x and y values are used to display as points in blue and as lines in red (Figure \@ref(fig:visAestheticsPtsLines)).

```{r visAestheticsPtsLines, fig.cap="Using aesthetics settings for both points and lines"}
sierraFeb %>%
  ggplot(aes(TEMPERATURE,ELEVATION)) +
  geom_point(color="blue") +
  geom_line(color="red")
```

> Note the use of pipe to start with the data then apply ggplot. This is one approach for creating graphs, and provides a fairly straightforward way to progress from data to visualization.

#### Color from variable, in aesthetics

\index{aesthetics}\index{color from variable}If color is connected to a variable within the `aes()` call, a color scheme is chosen to assign either a range (for continuous) or a set of unique colors (for discrete). In this graph, color is defined inside `aes`, so is based on COUNTY (Figure \@ref(fig:visColorFromVar)).

```{r visColorFromVar, fig.cap="Color set within aes()"}
ggplot(data=sierraFeb) + 
  geom_point(aes(TEMPERATURE, ELEVATION, color=COUNTY))

```

Note that counties represent discrete data, and this is detected by ggplot to assign an appropriate color scheme. Continuous data will require a different palette (Figure \@ref(fig:visSagehenQECcolorTemp)).

```{r visSagehenQECcolorTemp, fig.cap="Streamflow (Q) and specific electrical conductance (EC) for Sagehen Creek, colored by temperature"}
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate); library(igisci)
sagehen <- read_csv(ex("sierra/sagehen_dv.csv"))
ggplot(data=sagehen, aes(x=Q, y=EC, col=waterTmax)) + geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
```

**River map and profile**

\index{profile}We'll build a `riverData` dataframe with x and y location values and elevation. We'll need to start by creating empty vectors we'll populate with values in a loop: `d`, `longd`, and `s` are assigned an empty value `double()`, then slope `s` (since it only occurs between two points) needs one `NA` value assigned for the last point `s[length(x]` to have the same length as other vectors.

```{r visLongProfiles}
library(tidyverse)
x <- c(1000, 1100, 1300, 1500, 1600, 1800, 1900)
y <- c(500, 780, 820, 950, 1250, 1320, 1500)
elev <- c(0, 1, 2, 5, 25, 75, 150)
d <- double()      # creates an empty numeric vector 
longd <- double()  # ("double" means double-precision floating point)
s <- double()
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  if(i==1){longd[i] <- 0; d[i] <-0}
  else{
    d[i] <- sqrt((x[i]-x[i-1])^2 + (y[i]-y[i-1])^2)
    longd[i] <- longd[i-1] + d[i]
    s[i-1] <- (elev[i]-elev[i-1])/d[i]}}
s[length(x)] <- NA  # make the last slope value NA since we have no data past it, 
                    # and so the vector lengths are all the same
riverData <- bind_cols(x=x,y=y,elev=elev,d=d,longd=longd,s=s)
riverData
```

For this continuous data, a range of values is detected and a continous color scheme is assigned (Figure \@ref(fig:visGreenRed)). The ggplot `scale_color_gradient` function is used to establish end points of a color range that the data are stretched between  (Figure \@ref(fig:visGreenRedLongProf)). We can use this for many continuous variables, such as slope (Figure \@ref(fig:visSlopeLong)). The `scale_color_gradient2` lets you use a `mid` color. Note that there's a comparable `scale_fill_gradient` and `scale_fill_gradient2` for use when specifying a fill (e.g. for a polygon) instead of a color (for polygons linked to the border).

```{r visGreenRed, fig.cap="Channel slope as range from green to red, vertices sized by elevation"}
ggplot(riverData, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(col=s), size=1.2) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(col=s, size=elev)) +
  coord_fixed(ratio=1) + scale_color_gradient(low="green", high="red") +
  ggtitle("Simulated river path, elevations, and slopes")
```

```{r visGreenRedLongProf, fig.cap="Channel slope as range of line colors on a longitudinal profile"}
ggplot(riverData, aes(longd,elev)) + geom_line(aes(col=s), size=1.5) + geom_point()  +
  scale_color_gradient(low="green", high="red") +
  ggtitle("Longitudinal profile")
```

```{r visSlopeLong, fig.cap="Channel slope by longitudinal distance as scatter points colored by slope"}
ggplot(riverData, aes(longd,s)) + geom_point(aes(col=s), size=3) +
  scale_color_gradient(low="green", high="red") +
  ggtitle("Slope by longitudinal distance upstream")
```

Convert the built-in time series `treering` into a tibble `tr` using the `tibble()` function with the single variable assigned as `treering = treering` (or just specifying `treering` will also work for this simple example), then create a histogram, using that tibble and variable for the `data` and `x` settings needed. Attach a screen capture of the histogram. (Also, learn about the treering data by entering `?treering` in the console and read the Help displayed.)
